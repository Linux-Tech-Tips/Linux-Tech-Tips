# Hello there

## About me

I like tech, coding (obviously, who on this website doesn't?) and linux.

I can work with **Python**, **C/C++**, **Bash**, **Markdown** and **Java** (and **English** as well as a bit of **German**), with basic knowledge of **ARM/x86 ASM**, **Make**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, **TeX**, **PHP**, **SQL** and **PowerShell**. I also work with Blender, GIMP and Krita from time to time.

I use Fedora Linux (btw) with KDE Plasma desktop.

Student at University of Galway (BSc Computer Science).
