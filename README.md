# Hello there

## About me

I like tech, coding (obviously, who on this website doesn't?) and linux.

I can work with **Python**, **C/C++**, **Bash** and **Java**, with basic knowledge of **HTML/CSS/JS**, **PHP** and **PowerShell**. I also work with Blender, GIMP and Krita from time to time.

I use Debian Linux with KDE Plasma desktop.
