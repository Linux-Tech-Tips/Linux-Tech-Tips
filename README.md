# Hello there

## About me

I like tech in general, coding and linux.

I can work with **Java** and **Python** and am currently learning **C++** and **Rust**. I also like to work with Blender and GIMP from time to time, mostly to make assets.
I like to play video games, and am currently trying to make some games of my own.

I use Debian Linux with KDE Plasma desktop as my main OS.
