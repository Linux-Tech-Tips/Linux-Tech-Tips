# Hello there

## About me

I like coding and I like linux, if that isn't obvious by now.

I can work with **Java** and **Python** and am currently learning **C++** and **Rust**. I also like to work with Blender and GIMP from time to time, mostly to make assets.
I like to play video games, and am currently trying to make some games of my own.

I use Debian Linux with KDE Plasma desktop as my main OS. I like CLI Linux, having a terminal open as a part of a file explorer window in the same folder is a feature I really like about KDE Plasma desktop apps.
I like to code random projects for fun on my phone using Termux when I'm away from my laptop, and sometimes people around me think I'm _hacking_ lol.
