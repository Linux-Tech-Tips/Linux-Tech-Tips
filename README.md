# Hello there

## About me

I like tech, coding and linux (obviously, who on this website doesn't?).

I can work with **Java**, **Python** and **Bash** and am currently learning **C++** and **Rust**. I also work with Blender, GIMP and Krita from time to time.

I use Debian Linux with KDE Plasma desktop as my main OS.
