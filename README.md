# Hello there

## About me

I like tech, coding (obviously, who on this website doesn't?) and linux.

I can work with **Python**, **C/C++**, **Bash** and **Java** (and **English** as well as a bit of **German**), with basic knowledge of **Make**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, **Markdown**, **PHP**, **SQL** and **PowerShell**. I also work with Blender, GIMP and Krita from time to time.

I use Debian Linux (btw) with KDE Plasma desktop.
